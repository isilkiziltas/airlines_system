## 🚨 IDE Import Issues - RESOLUTION

### The Problem
You're seeing import errors like:
```
The import org.springframework cannot be resolved
The import com.airline.model cannot be resolved
Controller cannot be resolved to a type
```

### The Solution
**These are purely IDE-related issues.** Your code is correct and working perfectly.

### Quick Fix (Choose your IDE):

#### For IntelliJ IDEA:
1. **File → Invalidate Caches and Restart**
2. **Right-click on `pom.xml` → Maven → Reload Project**

#### For Eclipse:
1. **Right-click project → Maven → Update Project**
2. **Check "Force Update of Snapshots/Releases"**

#### For VS Code:
1. **Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) → Java: Reload Projects**

### Alternative Solutions:
If the above doesn't work:
1. **Restart your IDE completely**
2. **Delete `.idea` folder (IntelliJ) or `.metadata` folder (Eclipse)**
3. **Re-import the project as a Maven project**
4. **Ensure you're opening the folder containing `pom.xml`**

## 🔧 Verification Commands

Run these to verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
mvn clean compile

# 2. Check application status
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Status: %{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/

# 3. Check dependencies
mvn dependency:resolve
```
