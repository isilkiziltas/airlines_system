# IDE Import Issue Resolution Guide

## 🚨 Issue Description
You're seeing import errors in your IDE:
```
The import org.springframework cannot be resolved
SpringBootApplication cannot be resolved to a type
SpringApplication cannot be resolved
```

## ✅ Important: Your Application is Working!
**The import errors are IDE-related only.** Your application:
- ✅ Compiles successfully with Maven
- ✅ Runs perfectly on http://localhost:8080
- ✅ All functionality is working correctly
- ✅ All tests are passing

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Resolution

### Method 1: Refresh Maven Project (Recommended)

1. **In your IDE, right-click on the project root**
2. **Select "Maven" → "Reload Project"** (or "Refresh Dependencies")
3. **Wait for the IDE to re-index the project**

### Method 2: Clean and Rebuild

```bash
# In terminal, from project root
mvn clean compile
```

Then in your IDE:
1. **Project → Clean...**
2. **Select your project and click "Clean"**
3. **Project → Build Project**

### Method 3: Invalidate IDE Caches

1. **File → Invalidate Caches and Restart**
2. **Click "Invalidate and Restart"**
3. **Wait for IDE to restart and re-index**

### Method 4: Check Java Version

1. **Verify your IDE is using Java 17:**
   - **File → Project Structure**
   - **Project Settings → Project**
   - **Project SDK: Should be Java 17**
   - **Project language level: Should be 17**

2. **Check JAVA_HOME environment variable:**
   ```bash
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   java -version
   ```

### Method 5: Maven Configuration

1. **Ensure Maven is properly configured in your IDE:**
   - **File → Settings → Build Tools → Maven**
   - **Maven home path: Should point to your Maven installation**
   - **User settings file: Should point to settings.xml**

2. **Check that your IDE recognizes this as a Maven project:**
   - **Look for Maven tool window**
   - **Should show "airline-reservation-system" project**

## 🛠️ IDE-Specific Solutions

### For IntelliJ IDEA:
1. **File → Invalidate Caches and Restart**
2. **Right-click on pom.xml → Maven → Reload Project**
3. **File → Project Structure → Modules → Sources → Mark as Sources**
4. **File → Project Structure → Libraries → Add Maven Dependencies**

### For Eclipse:
1. **Right-click project → Maven → Update Project**
2. **Project → Clean...**
3. **Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → Add Java 17**

### For VS Code:
1. **Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) → Java: Reload Projects**
2. **Extensions → Java Extension Pack → Reload**
3. **Settings → Java Home → Set to Java 17 path**

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After applying any of the above methods:

1. **Check if imports are resolved:**
   ```java
   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   ```

2. **Verify Maven dependencies:**
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```

3. **Test compilation:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

4. **Check application status:**
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/
   ```

## 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Maven project is properly recognized by IDE
- [ ] Java 17 is set as project SDK
- [ ] Maven dependencies are downloaded
- [ ] Project is marked as Maven project
- [ ] IDE caches are cleared
- [ ] Project is rebuilt after changes

## 🎯 Quick Fix Commands

Run these commands in sequence:

```bash
# 1. Clean Maven
mvn clean

# 2. Download dependencies
mvn dependency:resolve

# 3. Compile
mvn compile

# 4. Verify application
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Status: %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/
```

## 📞 If Issues Persist

If the import errors continue after trying all methods:

1. **Restart your IDE completely**
2. **Delete the `.idea` folder (IntelliJ) or `.metadata` folder (Eclipse)**
3. **Re-import the project as a Maven project**
4. **Ensure you're opening the project root folder (where pom.xml is located)**

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the issue is resolved when:
- ✅ No red squiggly lines under Spring imports
- ✅ Code completion works for Spring classes
- ✅ "Go to Definition" works for Spring annotations
- ✅ Project compiles without IDE errors

## 📝 Note
Remember: **The import errors don't affect your application's functionality.** Your airline reservation system is fully operational and working correctly. These are purely IDE configuration issues that can be resolved with the steps above.
